# Plan to fix Netlify deploy errors

## Phase 1: Deployment-Blocking Issues ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Analyze error logs
- [x] Fix unexpected `any` types in `src/components/microphone-recorder.tsx`
- [x] Add missing dependencies to `useEffect` hook in `src/components/microphone-recorder.tsx`
- [x] Remove unused variable `handleTranscriptionUpdate` in `src/app/page.tsx`
- [x] Test the changes locally
- [x] Verify build and lint success

## Phase 2: Functional Issues (Next Priority)

- [ ] Fix speech recognition network errors
- [ ] Implement real-time state management for transcription
- [ ] Integrate actual translation API (currently using simulation)
- [ ] Add proper error handling for microphone permissions
- [ ] Test cross-browser compatibility
- [ ] Commit and push the changes

## Status: ✅ READY FOR NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT
All deployment-blocking issues have been resolved. The application now builds successfully and passes all linting checks.
