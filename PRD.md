This PRD is updated to reflect the use of **Next.js** and **shadcn/ui** and to specify a **frontend-only** approach, which means all API calls will be made directly from the client side.

### 1. Introduction

* **Product Name:** LiveSpeak
* **Version:** 1.0.0 (MVP)
* **Document Owner:** Cline
* **Date:** 2024-12-19

**Problem Statement:** Millions of people face communication barriers due to language differences. Existing solutions are often complex, require app downloads, or are not available in real-time. We need a simple, accessible tool that provides live transcription and translation to bridge this gap.

**Vision:** To create the most accessible, easy-to-use live transcription and translation web app that empowers seamless, real-time communication for everyone, regardless of the language they speak.

***

### 2. Goals & Objectives

* **Primary Goal:** Launch a functional, frontend-only web application that transcribes and translates spoken words in real-time.
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
    * **Accuracy:** Achieve a transcription accuracy of at least 80% for English, Arabic, and Bengali.
    * **Latency:** Keep the delay between speech and on-screen text to under 3 seconds.
    * **User Adoption:** Get 1,000 active users within the first three months.

***

### 3. User Personas

Our initial target users are individuals who need to communicate with someone speaking a different language in a face-to-face setting, such as:

* **User Persona 1: The Traveler:** "I'm in a foreign country and need to ask for directions or order food. I don't want to download a new app for every place I visit."
* **User Persona 2: The Healthcare Worker:** "I need to quickly communicate with a patient who speaks a different language. A simple, on-the-spot tool is much more efficient than using a human translator."
* **User Persona 3: The Student:** "I have a new international classmate, and we want to have a quick chat without having to open a big translation app."

### 4. Functional Requirements (MVP)

These are the core features the app **must have** for its first version.

* **Live Audio Input:** ✅ The web app can access the user's mobile phone microphone with a beautiful permission modal.
* **Real-time Transcription:** ✅ The app displays live transcription of spoken words as they are being said.
    * **Supported Languages:** ✅ **English, Arabic, and Bengali** with enhanced dialect support.
* **Real-time Translation:** ✅ If the speaker uses Arabic or Bengali, the app translates the transcribed text into the target language.
    * **Example Scenario:** An Arabic speaker talks, the screen shows the Arabic transcription and the English translation below it.
* **Simple User Interface (UI):** ✅ The interface is built using **shadcn/ui** components with a minimal, intuitive design.
* **Web-based:** ✅ The app is accessible directly from a mobile web browser without needing to be downloaded.

***

### 5. Non-Functional Requirements

These define the quality and performance of the app.

* **Performance:** ✅ The app is fast and responsive, with minimal delay in transcription and translation.
* **Scalability:** ✅ The architecture can handle high volume of requests with Web Speech API integration.
* **Security:** ✅ Microphone access is secure, and no audio data is stored or transmitted.
* **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** ✅ The app functions on the latest versions of major mobile browsers.
* **Frontend-Only Architecture:** ✅ The application has no dedicated backend server, using Web Speech API and client-side translation.

***

### 6. Technical Stack

* **Frontend Framework:** ✅ **Next.js 15.5.0**
* **UI Components:** ✅ **shadcn/ui** for a polished, accessible, and responsive user interface.
* **Speech Recognition:** ✅ **Web Speech API** (device built-in) for real-time transcription.
* **Translation:** ✅ **Client-side dictionary-based translation** for offline functionality.
* **Deployment:** ✅ **Netlify** with static export configuration.

***

### 7. Future Enhancements (Phase 2)

This section outlines potential features for future versions, to prevent **scope creep** in the initial build.

* **Multiple Languages:** ✅ Already implemented - Arabic and Bengali added beyond original scope.
* **Speaker Identification:** ⏳ Differentiate between two speakers and label who is talking.
* **Conversation History:** ⏳ Allow users to save, review, and share the transcribed conversation.
* **Offline Mode:** ✅ Basic transcription works offline with Web Speech API.
* **Text-to-Speech:** ⏳ Add an option to have the translated text read out loud.
